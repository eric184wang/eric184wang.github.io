Hi! I'm a third-year at UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Math–Economics. I’m excited about AI/ML and real-time systems, recently building VR LiDAR visualization and experimenting with deep learning for medical imaging.

## Education
**University of California, San Diego** (Sep 2022 – Jun 2026)  
B.S. Computer Science; B.S. Math–Economics — GPA 3.827 (Regents Scholar, top 1%)

*Selected coursework:* Advanced Data Structures/Algorithms, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AI (Search/Reasoning/Probabilistic), Recommender Systems & Web Mining, Computer Architecture

# Experience
**Software Engineering Intern — Piper Networks** (Jun 2025 – Present, San Diego, CA)  
- Built an Oculus-ready LiDAR viewer in Godot/GDScript; added distance-measurement tools and multithreaded rendering to modernize legacy features.  
- Implemented UWB testing & calibration in Python (validated in Excel) for the Piper Rail Positioning System—one of the only real-time train-safety platforms used in U.S. subways (MBTA, MTA)—achieving ≤200 mm positional accuracy.

**Instructional Assistant — UCSD CSE Department** (Jan 2024 – Present)  
- Teach and tutor data structures & algorithms; proctor weekly quizzes; coordinate on Slack and in weekly planning meetings.  
- 75+ hours of support each quarter, assisting 400+ students.

**Undergraduate Researcher — Economics (Prof. Paul Niehaus), UCSD** (Mar 2025 – Jun 2025)  
- Built Python data pipelines (BeautifulSoup, pandas, NumPy) to ingest and analyze large-scale household survey data.  
- Modeled funding needed (~1% of U.S. income) to lift populations above the international poverty line; produced reports for faculty and philanthropists.

**AI Coding Expert — Outlier AI** (Jun 2024 – May 2025, Remote)  
- Evaluated AI-generated code and authored programming questions to improve model accuracy across Java, Python, C, and C++.

# Projects
**Alzheimer’s Detection/Classification Using CNNs** (Jun – Aug 2024)  
- Multi-class CNN for MRI images; preprocessing + hyperparameter tuning; 92% accuracy; augmentation + dropout to prevent overfitting.  
- Explored QCNNs; collaborated on a Streamlit UI to make results accessible to non-technical users.  
_Tech:_ Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit

**Successorator (Android to-do app)** (Jan – Mar 2024)  
- Goal/task app with contexts and schedules; applied Agile + BDD, SOLID principles, and patterns (Strategy, Adapter, Observer, MVP, Builder).  
- Led a team of six; CI with GitHub Actions; Espresso tests and object mocking for reliability.  
_Tech:_ Java, SQL, Android Studio, JUnit, GitHub Actions

# Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Java, Python, C, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, ARM/x86 Assembly, MATLAB, GDScript  
- **Tools/Frameworks:** Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions CI, Android Studio, JUnit, Eclipse, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Godot Engine  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, TensorFlow, BeautifulSoup  
- **Certificates:** JPMorgan Career.edYou Academy (2023), AWS Cloud Tech Essentials (2024)
